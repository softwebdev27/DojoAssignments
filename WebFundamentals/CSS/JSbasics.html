                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility to developers to take it in many different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviornment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviornments to provide programmatic control over them.
                <ul id="ul4">
                     <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a></li><p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></p>
                     <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a></li><p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></p>
                     <li><a href="#">Data Type</a></li><p>Data types are an important concept. To be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p>
                     <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a></li><p>When you write code, you want to perform different action for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, execute this code in the code block; <span> else if</span> to specifty a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
                     <li><a href="#">Loops</a></li><p>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, and then you run around the track four times and then stop. Thats a loop!</p>
                    <li><a href="#">Function</a></li><p>Functions are an encaptulation of a code block. When we call our function, this will call that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the intruction manual and get started. First we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do, so lets call our function over, and over, and over again.
